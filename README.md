HI! Just clone and copy folder with docker-compose you need to your project root and type:
```
cd /project_root/<docker_compose_folder>
```
for example ```cd /var/www/html/myproject/php```

and then:
```
docker-compose up
```
to run all containers at once!

Main configuration is located in: ```.env``` file, feel free to edit!
